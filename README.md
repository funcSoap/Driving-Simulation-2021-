# Driving-Simulation-2021-
A trio of variants of my PHYS6017 Computer Techniques in Physics 23932 project 'Simulation of Traffic Flow'.

Driving With Friends Speeds: produces the 1st gif, where the colour-coding indicates speed of travel.
Driving With Friends Probs: produces the 2nd gif, where the colour-coding indicates the probability to randomly slow.
Driving With Friends Avg Speed & Density: outputs to the console the average speed and traffic density of the final tick of the simulation.

They are all very similar.
